SUMMARY
    Creates and modifies files.


DESCRIPTION
    The `File` task manages files. Pass the path to one or more files to the `Path` property. If you pass a path to a file that doesn't exist, it will be created, along with all necessary parent directories. The task uses PowerShell's `New-Item` cmdlet to create the file. By default, an empty file is created. To give the file specific content, pass that content to the Content property.

    If you pass paths of files that exist, or pass a path that contains wildcards, the task won't do anything to those existing files. If you pass the `Touch` property, it will update the file's last write time to the current date/time. If you pass the `Content` property, each file's content will be reset to that value.

PROPERTIES
    * `Path` (**mandatory**): one or more paths to file to create.
    * `Content`: the content of the file.
    * `Touch`: update the access date and/or modification date of a file
