SUMMARY
    Creates files.


DESCRIPTION
    The `CreateFile` task creates files. Pass the path to one or more files to create the `Path` property. Pass the content for the file to the `Content` property. If a file already exists, your build will fail. To overwrite any existing file, set the `Force` property to `true`. This task uses PowerShell's `New-Item` cmdlet to create the file and sets its content.  


PROPERTIES
    * `Path` (**mandatory**): one or more paths to file to create.
    * `Content`: the content of the file.
    * `Force`: overwrite a file, if it already exists. By default, the CreateFile task fails a build if a file already exists.

EXAMPLES

    ## Example 1

        Build:
        - CreateFile
            Path: file.txt
            Content: 'File content.'

    In this example, the file "file.txt" is created with the content "File content.".

    ## Example 2
        
        Build:
        - CreateFile:
            Path: file.txt

    In this example, an empty file is created
    
    ## Example 3
    
        Build:
        -CreateFile:
            Path: non-existing_directory\file.txt
            Content: 'File content.'
            Force: true

    This example demonstrates how to create the entire directory structure to a file and overwrite its contents (if it exists) with the "Force" parameter.
