SUMMARY
    Creates files.


DESCRIPTION
    The `CreateFile` task creates a file in the destination directory. Pass the path of the desired directory for the new file to the `Path` property. Pass the content for the new file to the `Content` property. If a file of the same name already exists, then pass 'true','yes', or '1' to the `Force` property. Otherwise the file will not be overwritten. Directories cannot be overwritten. Uses Powershell's `New-Item` cmdlet.


PROPERTIES
    * `Path` (**mandatory**): the path to the desired directory for the new file.
    * `Content`: the content to be added to the file. 
    * `Force`: allows a file to be overwritten. By default, it is set to *false*.

EXAMPLES

    ## Example 1

        Build:
        - CreateFile
            Path: file.txt
            Content: 'File content.'

    In this example, the file "file.txt" is created with the provided content.

    ## Example 2
        
        Build:
        - CreateFile:
            Path: file.txt

    In this example, an empty file is created
    
    ## Example 3
    
        Build:
        -CreateFile:
            Path: non-existing_directory\file.txt
            Content: 'File content.'
            Force: true

    In this example, the entire path will be created and any file by the same name will be overwritten.
